# All Planned Gamerules Added!
#### Next update (which will be shortly after this one) will be 1.21.9, the one after that (again shortly after that one) will be 1.21.10 support, I plan on supporting 1.21.8, 1.21.9, and 1.21.10 at the same time for the time being (and maybe backport to some older versions!)

Removed doesVinesSpread as you can do this in vanilla by shearing them
Had to remove canAnvilCostTooMuch for now as it is near impossible to do server side in a stable format.
