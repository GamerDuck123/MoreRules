# v1.0.1 Spigot Support & Small Updates

This update is a bit small for fabric and forge, as they just get a small update to fix some bugs, but nothing major.

This update however adds support for spigot and its forks, instead of previously only supporting paper and its forks.

Here is the currently supported for spigot gamerules:
