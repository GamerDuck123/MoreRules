# MoreRules

More rules is a plugin and mod that provides extra GameRules to allow fine-tuning of features on your server, while keeping it as vanilla as possible!

## The Basics

Both the mod and plugin inject their code into the /gamerule command, so its as simple as changing any other gamerule! You can see a list of supported gamerules below (a more indepth wiki will be coming soon)
