# MoreRules

More rules is a plugin and mod that provides extra GameRules to allow fine-tuning of features on your server, while keeping it as vanilla as possible!

## The Basics

Both the mod and plugin inject their code into the /gamerule command, so its as simple as changing any other gamerule! You can see a list of supported gamerules below (a more indepth wiki will be coming soon)

## Currently Supported GameRules
** Warning ** Forge and Nukkit Support have not yet been added.

canAnvilCostTooMuch currently doesn't support Paper due to the need to use Packets, which I would like to try and avoid as much as possible!
